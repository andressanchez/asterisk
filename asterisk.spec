%changelog
* Tue Sep 04 2012 Dan Horák <dan[at]danny.cz> - 11.0.0-0.3
- fix build on s390

* Tue Aug 18 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.0.0-0.2
- The Asterisk Development Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of
- Asterisk 11.0.0.  This release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- All interested users of Asterisk are encouraged to participate in the
- Asterisk 11 testing process.  Please report any issues found to the issue
- tracker, https://issues.asterisk.org/jira.  It is also very useful to see
- successful test reports.  Please post those to the asterisk-dev mailing list.
- All Asterisk users are invited to participate in the #asterisk-testing channel
- on IRC to work together in testing the many parts of Asterisk.
-
- Asterisk 11 is the next major release series of Asterisk.  It will be a Long
- Term Support (LTS) release, similar to Asterisk 1.8.  For more information about
- support time lines for Asterisk releases, see the Asterisk versions page:
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+Versions
-
- For important information regarding upgrading to Asterisk 11, please see the
- Asterisk wiki:
-
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Upgrading+to+Asterisk+11
-
- A short list of new features includes:
-
- * A new channel driver named chan_motif has been added which provides support
-   for Google Talk and Jingle in a single channel driver.  This new channel
-   driver includes support for both audio and video, RFC2833 DTMF, all codecs
-   supported by Asterisk, hold, unhold, and ringing notification. It is also
-   compliant with the current Jingle specification, current Google Jingle
-   specification, and the original Google Talk protocol.
-
- * Support for the WebSocket transport for chan_sip.
-
- * SIP peers can now be configured to support negotiation of ICE candidates.
-
- * The app_page application now no longer depends on DAHDI or app_meetme. It
-   has been re-architected to use app_confbridge internally.
-
- * Hangup handlers can be attached to channels using the CHANNEL() function.
-   Hangup handlers will run when the channel is hung up similar to the h
-   extension; however, unlike an h extension, a hangup handler is associated with
-   the actual channel and will execute anytime that channel is hung up,
-   regardless of where it is in the dialplan.
-
- * Added pre-dial handlers for the Dial and Follow-Me applications.  Pre-dial
-   allows you to execute a dialplan subroutine on a channel before a call is
-   placed but after the application performing a dial action is invoked. This
-   means that the handlers are executed after the creation of the caller/callee
-   channels, but before any actions have been taken to actually dial the callee
-   channels.
-
- * Log messages can now be easily associated with a certain call by looking at
-   a new unique identifier, "Call Id".  Call ids are attached to log messages for
-   just about any case where it can be determined that the message is related
-   to a particular call.
-
- * Introduced Named ACLs as a new way to define Access Control Lists (ACLs) in
-   Asterisk. Unlike traditional ACLs defined in specific module configuration
-   files, Named ACLs can be shared across multiple modules.
-
- * The Hangup Cause family of functions and dialplan applications allow for
-   inspection of the hangup cause codes for each channel involved in a call.
-   This allows a dialplan writer to determine, for each channel, who hung up and
-   for what reason(s).
-
- * Two new functions have been added: FEATURE() and FEATUREMAP(). FEATURE()
-   lets you set some of the configuration options from the general section
-   of features.conf on a per-channel basis. FEATUREMAP() lets you customize
-   the key sequence used to activate built-in features, such as blindxfer,
-   and automon.
-
- * Support for named pickupgroups/callgroups, allowing any number of pickupgroups
-   and callgroups to be defined for several channel drivers.
-
- * IPv6 Support for AMI, AGI, ExternalIVR, and the SIP Security Event Framework.
-
- More information about the new features can be found on the Asterisk wiki:
-
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+11+Documentation
-
- A full list of all new features can also be found in the CHANGES file.

* Wed Jul 18 2012 Fedora Release Engineering <rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org> - 10.5.2-1.2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_18_Mass_Rebuild

* Mon Jul 09 2012 Petr Pisar <ppisar@redhat.com> - 10.5.2-1.1
- Perl 5.16 rebuild

* Thu Jul  5 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.5.2-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.11 and Asterisk 1.8 and 10. The available security releases are
- released as versions 1.8.11-cert4, 1.8.13.1, 10.5.2, and 10.5.2-digiumphones.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.8.11-cert4, 1.8.13.1, 10.5.2, and 10.5.2-digiumphones
- resolve the following two issues:
-
- * If Asterisk sends a re-invite and an endpoint responds to the re-invite with
-   a provisional response but never sends a final response, then the SIP dialog
-   structure is never freed and the RTP ports for the call are never released. If
-   an attacker has the ability to place a call, they could create a denial of
-   service by using all available RTP ports.
-
- * If a single voicemail account is manipulated by two parties simultaneously,
-   a condition can occur where memory is freed twice causing a crash.
-
- These issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-010 and AST-2012-011, which were released at the
- same time as this announcement.

- The Asterisk Development Team has announced a security release for Asterisk 10.
- This security release is released as version 10.5.1.
-
- The release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 10.5.1 resolves the following issue:
-
- * A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability was found in the Skinny (SCCP)
-  Channel driver. When an SCCP client sends an Off Hook message, followed by
-  a Key Pad Button Message, a structure that was previously set to NULL is
-  dereferenced.  This allows remote authenticated connections the ability to
-  cause a crash in the server, denying services to legitimate users.
-
- This issue and its resolution is described in the security advisory.
-
- For more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read
- security advisory AST-2012-009, which was released at the same time as this

* Wed May 30 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.4.1-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.11 and Asterisk 1.8 and 10. The available security releases are
- released as versions 1.8.11-cert2, 1.8.12.1, and 10.4.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.8.11-cert2, 1.8.12.1, and 10.4.1 resolve the following
- two issues:
-
- * A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the IAX2 channel
-  driver if an established call is placed on hold without a suggested music
-  class. Asterisk will attempt to use an invalid pointer to the music
-  on hold class name, potentially causing a crash.
-
- * A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability was found in the Skinny (SCCP)
-  Channel driver. When an SCCP client closes its connection to the server,
-  a pointer in a structure is set to NULL.  If the client was not in the
-  on-hook state at the time the connection was closed, this pointer is later
-  dereferenced. This allows remote authenticated connections the ability to
-  cause a crash in the server, denying services to legitimate users.
-
- These issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read

* Tue Apr 24 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.3.1-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Asterisk 1.6.2,
- 1.8, and 10. The available security releases are released as versions 1.6.2.24,
- 1.8.11.1, and 10.3.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.6.2.24, 1.8.11.1, and 10.3.1 resolve the following two
- issues:
-
-  * A permission escalation vulnerability in Asterisk Manager Interface.  This
-   would potentially allow remote authenticated users the ability to execute
-   commands on the system shell with the privileges of the user running the
-   Asterisk application.
-
-  * A heap overflow vulnerability in the Skinny Channel driver.  The keypad
-   button message event failed to check the length of a fixed length buffer
-   before appending a received digit to the end of that buffer.  A remote
-   authenticated user could send sufficient keypad button message events that the
-   buffer would be overrun.
-
- In addition, the release of Asterisk 1.8.11.1 and 10.3.1 resolve the following
- issue:
-
-  * A remote crash vulnerability in the SIP channel driver when processing UPDATE
-   requests.  If a SIP UPDATE request was received indicating a connected line
-   update after a channel was terminated but before the final destruction of the
-   associated SIP dialog, Asterisk would attempt a connected line update on a
-   non-existing channel, causing a crash.
-
- These issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-004, AST-2012-005, and AST-2012-006, which were
- released at the same time as this announcement.

* Thu Feb 16 2012 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.1.0-1
- The Asterisk Development Team is pleased to announce the release of
- Asterisk 10.1.0. This release is available for immediate download at

-
- The release of Asterisk 10.1.0 resolves several issues reported by the
- community and would have not been possible without your participation.
- Thank you!
-
- The following is a sample of the issues resolved in this release:
-
- * AST-2012-001: prevent crash when an SDP offer
-  is received with an encrypted video stream when support for video
-  is disabled and res_srtp is loaded.  (closes issue ASTERISK-19202)
-  Reported by: Catalin Sanda
-
- * Allow playback of formats that don't support seeking.  ast_streamfile
-  previously did unconditional seeking on files that broke playback of
-  formats that don't support that functionality.  This patch avoids the
-  seek that was causing the problem.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-18994) Patched by: Timo Teras
-
- * Add pjmedia probation concepts to res_rtp_asterisk's learning mode.  In
-  order to better handle RTP sources with strictrtp enabled (which is the
-  default setting in 10) using the learning mode to figure out new sources
-  when they change is handled by checking for a number of consecutive (by
-  sequence number) packets received to an rtp struct based on a new
-  configurable value called 'probation'.  Also, during learning mode instead
-  of liberally accepting all packets received, we now reject packets until a
-  clear source has been determined.
-
- * Handle AST_CONTROL_UPDATE_RTP_PEER frames in local bridge loop.  Failing
-  to handle AST_CONTROL_UPDATE_RTP_PEER frames in the local bridge loop
-  causes the loop to exit prematurely. This causes a variety of negative side
-  effects, depending on when the loop exits. This patch handles the frame by
-  essentially swallowing the frame in the local loop, as the current channel
-  drivers expect the RTP bridge to handle the frame, and, in the case of the
-  local bridge loop, no additional action is necessary.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-19095) Reported by: Stefan Schmidt Tested
-  by: Matt Jordan
-
- * Fix timing source dependency issues with MOH.  Prior to this patch,
-  res_musiconhold existed at the same module priority level as the timing
-  sources that it depends on.  This would cause a problem when music on
-  hold was reloaded, as the timing source could be changed after
-  res_musiconhold was processed. This patch adds a new module priority
-  level, AST_MODPRI_TIMING, that the various timing modules are now loaded
-  at. This now occurs before loading other resource modules, such
-  that the timing source is guaranteed to be set prior to resolving
-  the timing source dependencies.

-
- * Fix RTP reference leak.  If a blind transfer were initiated using a
-  REFER without a prior reINVITE to place the call on hold, AND if Asterisk
-  were sending RTCP reports, then there was a reference leak for the
-  RTP instance of the transferrer.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-19192) Reported by: Tyuta Vitali
-
- * Fix blind transfers from failing if an 'h' extension
-  is present.  This prevents the 'h' extension from being run on the
-  transferee channel when it is transferred via a native transfer
-  mechanism such as SIP REFER.  (closes issue ASTERISK-19173) Reported
-  by: Ross Beer Tested by: Kristjan Vrban Patches: ASTERISK-19173 by
-  Mark Michelson (license 5049)
-
- * Restore call progress code for analog ports. Extracting sig_analog
-  from chan_dahdi lost call progress detection functionality.  Fix
-  analog ports from considering a call answered immediately after
-  dialing has completed if the callprogress option is enabled.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-18841)
-  Reported by: Richard Miller Patched by Richard Miller
-
- * Fix regression that 'rtp/rtcp set debup ip' only works when a port
-  was also specified.

-
- * T.38 gateway functionality has been added to res_fax.
- * Protocol independent out-of-call messaging support. Text messages not
-  associated with an active call can now be routed through the Asterisk
-  dialplan. SIP and XMPP are supported so far.
- * New highly optimized and customizable ConfBridge application capable of mixing
-  audio at sample rates ranging from 8kHz-192kHz
- * Addition of video_mode option in confbridge.conf to provide basic video
-  conferencing in the ConfBridge() dialplan application.
- * Support for defining hints has been added to pbx_lua.
- * Replacement of Berkeley DB with SQLite for the Asterisk Database (AstDB).

* Fri Dec  9 2011 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.0.0-0.7.rc3
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced the third release candidate of
- Asterisk 10.0.0. This release candidate is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/
-
- The release of Asterisk 10.0.0-rc3 resolves several issues reported by the
- community and would have not been possible without your participation.
- Thank you!
-
- The following is a sample of the issues resolved in this release candidate:
-
- * Add ASTSBINDIR to the list of configurable paths
-
-  This patch also makes astdb2sqlite3 and astcanary use the configured
-  directory instead of relying on $PATH.
-
- * Don't crash on INFO automon request with no channel
-
-  AST-2011-014. When automon was enabled in features.conf, it was possible
-  to crash Asterisk by sending an INFO request if no channel had been
-  created yet.
-
- * Fixed crash from orphaned MWI subscriptions in chan_sip
-
-  This patch resolves the issue where MWI subscriptions are orphaned
-  by subsequent SIP SUBSCRIBE messages.
-
- * Fix a change in behavior in 'database show' from 1.8.
-
-  In 1.8 and previous versions, one could use any fullword portion of
-  the key name, including the full key, to obtain the record. Until this
-  patch, this did not work for the full key.
-
- * Default to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ
-
-  AST-2011-013.  It is possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
-  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a request is
-  sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via header. In 1.4 and
-  1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was nat=yes or nat=route and the other
-  was either nat=no or nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one
-  was nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no.
-
-  In order to address this problem, it was decided to switch the default
-  behavior to nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option
-  and to strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
-  possible.
-
- * Fixed SendMessage stripping extension from To: header in SIP MESSAGE
-
-  When using the MessageSend application to send a SIP MESSAGE to a
-  non-peer, chan_sip stripped off the extension and failed to add it back
-  to the sip_pvt structure before transmitting. This patch adds the full
-  URI passed in from the message core to the sip_pvt structure.

- following issue:
-
- AST-2011-011: Asterisk may respond differently to SIP requests from an
- invalid SIP user than it does to a user configured on the system, even
- when the alwaysauthreject option is set in the configuration. This can
- leak information about what SIP users are valid on the Asterisk
- system.
-
- For more information about the details of this vulnerability, please

- 1.4.41.1, 1.6.2.18.1, and 1.8.4.3, which are security releases.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.4.41.1, 1.6.2.18, and 1.8.4.3 resolves several issues
- as outlined below:
-
- * AST-2011-008: If a remote user sends a SIP packet containing a null,
-  Asterisk assumes available data extends past the null to the
-  end of the packet when the buffer is actually truncated when
-  copied.  This causes SIP header parsing to modify data past
-  the end of the buffer altering unrelated memory structures.
-  This vulnerability does not affect TCP/TLS connections.
-  -- Resolved in 1.6.2.18.1 and 1.8.4.3
-
- * AST-2011-009: A remote user sending a SIP packet containing a Contact header
-  with a missing left angle bracket (<) causes Asterisk to
-  access a null pointer.
-  -- Resolved in 1.8.4.3
-
- * AST-2011-010: A memory address was inadvertently transmitted over the
-  network via IAX2 via an option control frame and the remote party would try
-  to access it.
-  -- Resolved in 1.4.41.1, 1.6.2.18.1, and 1.8.4.3
-
- The issues and resolutions are described in the AST-2011-008, AST-2011-009, and
- AST-2011-010 security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read

* Wed Oct  6 2010 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.8.0-0.6.rc2
- This release candidate contains fixes since the last beta release as reported by
- the community. A sampling of the changes in this release candidate include:
-
-  * Add slin16 support for format_wav (new wav16 file extension)
-    (Closes issue #15029. Reported, patched by andrew. Tested by Qwell)
-
-  * Fixes a bug in manager.c where the default configuration values weren't reset
-    when the manager configuration was reloaded.
-    (Closes issue #17917. Reported by lmadsen. Patched by bbryant)
-
-  * Various fixes for the calendar modules.
-    (Patched by Jan Kalab.
-     Reviewboard: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/880/
-     Closes issue #17877. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/916/
-     Closes issue #17776. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/921/)
-
-  * Add CHANNEL(checkhangup) to check whether a channel is in the process of
-    being hung up.
-    (Closes issue #17652. Reported, patched by kobaz)
-
-  * Fix a bug with MeetMe where after announcing the amount of time left in a
-    conference, if music on hold was playing, it doesn't restart.
-    (Closes issue #17408, Reported, patched by sysreq)
-
-  * Fix interoperability problems with session timer behavior in Asterisk.
-    (Closes issue #17005. Reported by alexcarey. Patched by dvossel)
-
-  * Rate limit calls to fsync() to 1 per second after astdb updates. Astdb was
-    determined to be one of the most significant bottlenecks in SIP registration
-    processing. This patch improved the speed of an astdb load test by 50000%
-    (yes, Fifty-Thousand Percent). On this particular load test setup, this
-    doubled the number of SIP registrations the server could handle.
-    (Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/825/)
-
-  * Don't clear the username from a realtime database when a registration
-    expires. Non-realtime chan_sip does not clear the username from memory when a
-    registration expiries so realtime probably shouldn't either.
-    (Closes issue #17551. Reported, patched by: ricardolandim. Patched by
-     mnicholson)
-
-  * Don't hang up a call on an SRTP unprotect failure. Also make it more obvious
-    when there is an issue en/decrypting.
-    (Closes issue #17563. Reported by Alexcr. Patched by sfritsch. Tested by
-     twilson)
-
-  * Many more issues. This is a significant upgrade over Asterisk 1.8.0 beta 5!

-    (Closes issue #17890. Reported, patched by elguero)
-
-  * Change pedantic default value in chan_sip from 'no' to 'yes'
-
-  * Asterisk now dynamically builds the "Supported" header depending on what is
-    enabled/disabled in sip.conf. Session timers used to always be advertised as
-    being supported even when they were disabled in the configuration.
-    (Related to issue #17005. Patched by dvossel)
-
-  * Convert MOH to use generic timers.
-    (Closes issue #17726. Reported by lmadsen. Patched by tilghman)
-
-  * Fix SRTP for changing SSRC and multiple a=crypto SDP lines. Adding code to
-    Asterisk that changed the SSRC during bridges and masquerades broke SRTP
-    functionality. Also broken was handling the situation where an incoming
-    INVITE had more than one crypto offer.
-    (Closes issue #17563. Reported by Alexcr. Patched by twilson)

-
-  * Change the default value for alwaysauthreject in sip.conf to "yes".
-    (Closes issue #17756. Reported by oej)
-
-  * Remove current STUN support from chan_sip.c. This change removes the current
-    broken/useless STUN support from chan_sip.
-    (Closes issue #17622. Reported by philipp2.
-     Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/855/)
-
-  * PRI CCSS may use a stale dial string for the recall dial string. If an
-    outgoing call negotiates a different B channel than initially requested, the
-    saved original dial string was not transferred to the new B channel. CCSS
-    uses that dial string to generate the recall dial string.
-    (Patched by rmudgett)
-
-  * Split _all_ arguments before parsing them. This fixes multicast RTP paging
-    using linksys mode.
-    (Patched by russellb)
-
-  * Expand cel_custom.conf.sample. Include the usage of CSV_QUOTE() to ensure
-    data has valid CSV formatting. Also list the special CEL variables that are
-    available for use in the mapping. There are also several other CEL fixes in
-    this release.

-    (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/804)
-
-  * Fix parsing error in sip_sipredirect(). The code was written in a way that

-
-  * Fixed IPv6-related SIP parsing bugs and updated documention.
